## AfxPathAddBackSlash

Adds a backslash to the end of a string to create the correct syntax for a path. If the source path already has a trailing backslash, no backslash will be added.

```
FUNCTION AfxPathAddBackSlash (BYREF wszPath AS CONST WSTRING) AS DWSTRING
```

| Parameter  | Description |
| ---------- | ----------- |
| *wszPath* | A string that represents a path. |

#### Return value

The changed path.

#### Usage example

```
DIM dws AS DWSTRING = AfxPathAddBackSlash("C:\dir_name\dir_name\file_name")
```
---

## AfxPathAddExtension

Adds a file name extension to a path string.

```
FUNCTION AfxPathAddExtension (BYREF wszPath AS CONST WSTRING, BYVAL pwszExt AS WSTRING PTR = NULL) AS DWSTRING
```

| Parameter  | Description |
| ---------- | ----------- |
| *wszPath* | A string that represents a path. |
| *pwszExt* | A string that contains the file name extension. |

#### Return value

The changed path.

#### Remarks

If there is already a file name extension present, no extension will be added. If the *wszPath* is an empty string, the result will be the file name extension only. If *wszExtension* is an empty string, an ".exe" extension will be added.

#### Usage examples

```
DIM dws AS DWSTRING = AfxPathAddExtension("file") ' output: file.exe
DIM dws AS DWSTRING = AfxPathAddExtension("file.doc") ' output: file.doc
DIM dws AS DWSTRING = AfxPathAddExtension("file", ".txt") ' output: file.txt
DIM dws AS DWSTRING = AfxPathAddExtension("", ".txt") ' output: .txt
```
---

## AfxPathAppend

Appends one path to the end of another.

```
FUNCTION AfxPathAppend (BYREF wszPath AS CONST WSTRING, BYREF wszMore AS CONST WSTRING) AS DWSTRING
```

| Parameter  | Description |
| ---------- | ----------- |
| *wszPath* | A string that represents a path. |
| *wszMore* | A string that contains the path to be appended. |

#### Return value

The changed path.

#### Remarks

This function automatically inserts a backslash between the two strings, if one is not already present.

The path supplied in *wszPath* cannot begin with "..\\" or ".\\" to produce a relative path string. If present, those periods are stripped from the output string. For example, appending "path3" to "..\\path1\\path2" results in an output of "\\path1\\path2\\path3" rather than "..\\path1\\path2\\path3".

#### Usage example

```
DIM dws AS DWSTRING = AfxPathAppend("name_1\name_2", "name_3")
```
---

## AfxPathBuildRoot

Creates a root path from a given drive number.

```
FUNCTION AfxPathBuildRoot (BYVAL nDrive AS LONG) AS DWSTRING
```

| Parameter  | Description |
| ---------- | ----------- |
| *nDrive* | A variable of type LONG that indicates the desired drive number. It should be between 0 and 25. |

#### Return value

The root path. If the call fails for any reason (for example, an invalid drive number), an empty string is returned.

#### Usage example

```
DIM dws AS DWSTRING = AfxPathBuildRoot(2) ' output: C:\
```
---

## AfxPathCanonicalize

Removes elements of a file path according to special strings inserted into that path.

```
FUNCTION AfxPathCanonicalize (BYREF wszPath AS CONST WSTRING) AS DWSTRING
```

| Parameter  | Description |
| ---------- | ----------- |
| *wszPath* | A string that contains the path to be canonicalized. |

#### Return value

The canonicalized path.

#### Remarks

This function allows the user to specify what to remove from a path by inserting special character sequences into the path. The ".." sequence indicates to remove a path segment from the current position to the previous path segment. The "." sequence indicates to skip over the next path segment to the following path segment. The root segment of the path cannot be removed.

If there are more ".." sequences than there are path segments, the contents of the returned string contains just the root, "\\".

#### Usage example

```
DIM dws AS DWSTRING = AfxPathCanonicalize("A:\name_1\.\name_2\..\sname_3") ' output: A:\name_1\name_3
DIM dws AS DWSTRING = AfxPathCanonicalize("A:\name_1\..\name_2\.\name_3") ' output: A:\name_2\name_3
DIM dws AS DWSTRING = AfxPathCanonicalize("A:\name_1\name_2\.\name_3\..\name_4") ' output: A:\name_1\name_2\name_4
DIM dws AS DWSTRING = AfxPathCanonicalize("A:\name_1\.\name_2\.\name_3\..\name_4\..") ' output: A:\name_1\name_2
DIM dws AS DWSTRING = AfxPathCanonicalize("C:\..") ' output: C:\
```
---

## AfxPathCombine

FUNCTION AfxPathCombine (BYREF wszDir AS CONST WSTRING, BYREF wszFile AS CONST WSTRING) AS DWSTRING
```

| Parameter  | Description |
| ---------- | ----------- |
| *wszDir* | A string that contains the directory path. This value can be "". |
| *wszFile* | A string that contains the file path. This value can be "". |

#### Return value

The concatenated path if successful, or an empty string otherwise.

#### Remarks

The directory path should be in the form of A:,B:, ..., Z:. The file path should be in a correct form that represents the file part of the path. The file path must not be null, and if it ends with a backslash, the backslash will be maintained.

#### Usage example

```
DIM dws AS DWSTRING = AfxPathCombine("C:", "One\Two\Three") ' output: C:\One\Two\Three
```
---

## AfxPathCommonPrefix

Compares two paths to determine if they share a common prefix. A prefix is one of these types: "C:\\", ".", "..", "..\\".

```

| Parameter  | Description |
| ---------- | ----------- |
| *hDC* | A handle to the device context used for font metrics. This value can be NULL. |
| *wszPath* | A string that contains the path to be modified. |
| *dx* | The width, in pixels, in which the string must fit. |

#### Return value

The compacted path.

#### Remarks

This function uses the font currently selected in *hDC* to calculate the width of the text. This function will not compact the path beyond the base file name preceded by ellipses.

#### Usage example

```
DIM dws AS DWSTRING = AfxPathCompactPath(NULL, "C:\path1\path2\sample.txt", 180)
```
---

## AfxPathCompactPathEx

Truncates a path to fit within a certain number of characters by replacing path components with ellipses.

FUNCTION AfxPathCompactPathEx (BYREF wszPath AS CONST WSTRING, BYVAL cchMax AS DWORD) AS DWSTRING
```

| Parameter  | Description |
| ---------- | ----------- |
| *wszPath* | A string that contains the path to be altered. |
| *cchMax* | The maximum number of characters to be contained in the new string, including the terminating null character. For example, if *cchMax* = 8, the resulting string can contain a maximum of 7 characters plus the terminating null character. |

#### Return value

The compacted path.

#### Remarks

The '/' separator will be used instead of '\\' if the original string used it. If *wszPath* points to a file name that is too long, instead of a path, the file name will be truncated to *cchMax* characters, including the ellipsis and the terminating NULL character. For example, if the input file name is "My Filename" and *cchMax* is 10, *AfxPathCompactPathEx* will return "My Fil...".

#### Usage example

```
DIM dws AS DWSTRING = AfxPathCompactPathEx("c:\test\My Filename", 18)
```
---

## AfxPathCreateFromUrl

#### Return value

The MS-DOS path.

#### Usage example

```
DIM dws AS DWSTRING = AfxPathCreateFromUrl("file:///C:/Documents%20and%20Settings/URIS.txt")
```
---

## AfxPathFileExists

Determines whether a path to a file system object such as a file or directory is valid.

```
FUNCTION AfxPathFileExists (BYREF wszPath AS WSTRING) AS BOOLEAN
```

| Parameter  | Description |
| ---------- | ----------- |
| *wszPath* | A string that contains the full path of the object to verify. |

#### Return value

Returns TRUE if the file exists, or FALSE otherwise.

#### Remarks

This function tests the validity of the path.

A path specified by Universal Naming Convention (UNC) is limited to a file only; that is, \\\\server\\share\file is permitted. A UNC path to a server or server share is not permitted; that is, \\\\server or \\\\server\\share. This function returns FALSE if a mounted remote drive is out of service.

---

## AfxPathFindExtension

Searches a path for an extension.

```
FUNCTION AfxPathFindExtension (BYREF wszPath AS CONST WSTRING) AS DWSTRING
```

| Parameter  | Description |
| ---------- | ----------- |
| *wszPath* | A string that contains the path to search, including the extension being searched for. |

#### Return value

The file name extension.

#### Remarks

---

## AfxPathFindNextComponent

Searches a path for a file name.

```
FUNCTION AfxPathFindNextComponent (BYREF wszPath AS CONST WSTRING) AS DWSTRING
```

| Parameter  | Description |
| ---------- | ----------- |
| *wszPath* | A string that contains the path to parse. This string must not be longer than MAX_PATH characters, plus the terminating null character. Path components are delimited by backslashes. For instance, the path "c:\\path1\\path2\\file.txt" has four components: c:, path1, path2, and file.txt. |

#### Return value

The truncated path.

#### Remarks

**AfxPathFindNextComponent** walks a path string until it encounters a backslash ("\\"), ignores everything up to that point including the backslash, and returns the rest of the path. Therefore, if a path begins with a backslash (such as \\path1\\path2), the function simply removes the initial backslash and returns the rest (path1\\path2).

#### Usage example

```
DIM dws AS DWSTRING = AfxPathFindNextComponent("C:\TEST\file.txt")
```
---

## AfxPathFindOnPath

Searches for a file.

```
FUNCTION AfxPathFindOnPath (BYREF wszFile AS CONST WSTRING, _

| Parameter  | Description |
| ---------- | ----------- |
| *wszFile* | A string that contains the file name for which to search. If the search is successful, this parameter is used to return the fully-qualified path name. |
| *ppwszOtherDirs* | An optional, null-terminated array of directories to be searched first. This value can be NULL. |

#### Return value

The fully-qualified path name on success or an empty string on failure.

#### Remarks

**AfxPathFindOnPath** searches for the file specified by *wszFile*. If no directories are specified in *ppwszOtherDirs*, it attempts to find the file by searching standard directories such as System32 and the directories specified in the PATH environment variable. To expedite the process or enable **AfxPathFindOnPath** to search a wider range of directories, use the *ppwszOtherDirs* parameter to specify one or more directories to be searched first. If more than one file has the name specified by *wszFile*, **AfxPathFindOnPath** returns the first instance it finds.

---

## AfxPathFindSuffixArray

Determines whether a given file name has one of a list of suffixes.

```
FUNCTION AfxPathFindSuffixArray (BYREF wszPath AS WSTRING, BYVAL apwszSuffix AS WSTRING PTR PTR, _
   BYVAL iArraySize AS LONG) AS DWSTRING

| *iArraySize* | The number of elements in the array pointed to by *apwszSuffix*. |

#### Return value

The matching suffix if successful, or an empty string if bstrPath does not end with one of the specified suffixes.

#### Remarks

This function uses a case-sensitive comparison. The suffix must match exactly.

---

| *dwFlags* | Modifies the search condition. The following are valid flags:<br>*PMSF_NORMAL* (&h00000000): The *wszSpec* parameter points to a single file type extension to be matched.<br>*PMSF_MULTIPLE* (&h00000001): The *wszSpec* parameter points to a semicolon-delimited list of file type extensions to be matched.<br>*PMSF_DONT_STRIP_SPACES* (&h00010000): If PMSF_NORMAL is used, ignore leading spaces in the string pointed to by *wszSpec*. If PMSF_MULTIPLE is used, ignore leading spaces in each file type contained in the string pointed to by *wszSpec*. This flag can be combined with PMSF_NORMAL and PMSF_MULTIPLE. |

#### Return value

Returns one of the following values:

| Return code | Description |
| ----------- | ----------- |
| TRUE | A file type extension specified in *wszSpec* was found in the path pointed to by *wszFile*. |
| FALSE | The path pointed to by *wszFile* does not contain any file type extension specified in *wszSpec*. |

| ---------- | ----------- |
| *wszIconFile* | A string that contains a file location string. It should be in the form "*path,iconindex*". |

#### Return value

Returns the valid icon index value.

#### Remarks

This function is useful for taking a DefaultIcon value retrieved from the registry by **SHGetValue** and separating the icon index from the path.

#### Usage example

```
DIM dwsIconLocation AS DWSTRING = AfxPathParseIconLocation("C:\TEST\sample.txt,3")
```
---

## AfxPathQuoteSpaces

Searches a path for spaces. If spaces are found, the entire path is enclosed in quotation marks.

```
FUNCTION AfxPathQuoteSpaces (BYREF wszPath AS CONST WSTRING) AS DWSTRING
```

| Parameter  | Description |
| ---------- | ----------- |
| *wszPath* | A string that contains the path to be searched. |

#### Return value

---

## AfxPathRelativePathTo

Creates a relative path from one file or folder to another.

```
FUNCTION AfxPathRelativePathTo (BYREF wszFrom AS CONST WSTRING, BYVAL dwAttrFrom AS DWORD, _
   BYREF wszTo AS CONST WSTRING, BYVAL dwAttrTo AS DWORD) AS DWSTRING
```

| Parameter  | Description |
| ---------- | ----------- |
| *wszFrom* | A string that contains the path that defines the start of the relative path. |
| *dwAttrFrom* | The file attributes of *wszFrom*. If this value contains FILE_ATTRIBUTE_DIRECTORY, *wszFrom* is assumed to be a directory; otherwise, *wszFrom* is assumed to be a file. |
| *wszTo* | A string that contains the path that defines the endpoint of the relative path. |
| *dwAttrTo* | The file attributes of wszTo. If this value contains FILE_ATTRIBUTE_DIRECTORY, wszTo is assumed to be directory; otherwise, *wszTo* is assumed to be a file. |

#### Return value

Returns True if successful, or False otherwise.

#### Remarks

This function takes a pair of paths and generates a relative path from one to the other. The paths do not have to be fully-qualified, but they must have a common prefix, or the function will fail and return False.

For example, let the starting point, *wszFrom*, be "c:\\FolderA\FolderB\\FolderC", and the ending point, *wszTo*, be "c:\\FolderA\\FolderD\\FolderE". **AfxPathRelativePathTo** will return the relative path from *wszFrom* to *wszTo* as: "..\\..\\FolderD\\FolderE". You will get the same result if you set *wszFrom* to "\\FolderA\\FolderB\\FolderC" and *wszTo* to "\\FolderA\\FolderD\\FolderE". On the other hand, "c:\\FolderA\\FolderB" and "a:\\FolderA\\FolderD do not share a common prefix, and the function will fail. Note that "\\\\" is not considered a prefix and is ignored. If you set *wszFrom* to "\\\\FolderA\\FolderB", and *wszTo* to "\\\\FolderC\\FolderD", the function will fail.

---

## AfxPathRemoveArgs

## AfxUrlApplyScheme

Determines a scheme for a specified URL string, and returns a string with an appropriate prefix.

```
FUNCTION AfxUrlApplyScheme (BYREF wszUrl AS WSTRING, BYVAL dwFlags AS DWORD) AS DWSTRING
```

| Parameter  | Description |
| ---------- | ----------- |
| *wszUrl* | A string that contains a URL. |
| *dwFlags* | The flags that specify how to determine the scheme. The flags can be combined. |

| Flag       | Description |
| ---------- | ----------- |
| URL_APPLY_DEFAULT | Apply the default scheme if **AfxUrlApplyScheme** can't determine one. The default prefix is stored in the registry but is typically "http". |
| URL_APPLY_GUESSSCHEME | Attempt to determine the scheme by examining *wszUrl*. |
| URL_APPLY_GUESSFILE | Attempt to determine a file URL from *wszUrl*. |
| URL_APPLY_FORCEAPPLY | Force **AfxUrlApplyScheme** to determine a scheme for *wszUrl*. |
| URL_APPLY_FORCEAPPLY | Force **AfxUrlApplyScheme** to determine a scheme for *wszUrl*. |

#### Return value

The changed url.

#### Remarks

If the URL has a valid scheme, the string will not be modified. However, almost any combination of two or more characters followed by a colon will be parsed as a scheme. Valid characters include some common punctuation marks, such as ".". If your input string fits this description, **AfxUrlApplyScheme** may treat it as valid and not apply a scheme. To force the function to apply a scheme to a URL, set the URL_APPLY_FORCEAPPLY and URL_APPLY_DEFAULT flags in *dwFlags*. This combination of flags forces the function to apply a scheme to the URL. Typically, the function will not be able to determine a valid scheme. The second flag guarantees that, if no valid scheme can be determined, the function will apply the default scheme to the URL.

---

## AfxUrlCanonicalize

Converts a URL string into canonical form.

```
FUNCTION AfxUrlCanonicalize (BYREF wszUrl AS WSTRING, BYVAL dwFlags AS DWORD) AS DWSTRING
```

| Parameter  | Description |
| ---------- | ----------- |
| *wszUrl* | A string that contains a URL. If the string does not refer to a file, it must include a valid scheme such as "http://". |
| *dwFlags* | The flags that specify how the URL is converted to canonical form. The flags can be combined. |

| Flag       | Description |
| ---------- | ----------- |
| URL_UNESCAPE | Un-escape any escape sequences that the URLs contain, with two exceptions. The escape sequences for "?" and "#" are not un-escaped. If one of the URL_ESCAPE_XXX flags is also set, the two URLs are first un-escaped, then combined, then escaped. |
| URL_ESCAPE_UNSAFE | Replace unsafe characters with their escape sequences. Unsafe characters are those characters that may be altered during transport across the Internet, and include the (<, >, ", #, {, }, \|, \\, ^, \[, ], and ') characters. This flag applies to all URLs, including opaque URLs. |
| URL_PLUGGABLE_PROTOCOL | Combine URLs with client-defined pluggable protocols, according to the W3C specification. This flag does not apply to standard protocols such as ftp, http, gopher, and so on. If this flag is set, **AfxUrlCombine** does not simplify URLs, so there is no need to also set URL_DONT_SIMPLIFY. |
| URL_ESCAPE_SPACES_ONLY | Replace only spaces with escape sequences. This flag takes precedence over URL_ESCAPE_UNSAFE, but does not apply to opaque URLs. |
| URL_DONT_SIMPLIFY | Treat "/./" and "/../" in a URL string as literal characters, not as shorthand for navigation. See Remarks for further discussion. |
| URL_NO_META | Defined to be the same as URL_DONT_SIMPLIFY. |
| URL_ESCAPE_PERCENT | Convert any occurrence of "%" to its escape sequence. |
| URL_ESCAPE_AS_UTF8 | Windows 7 and later. Percent-encode all non-ASCII characters as their UTF-8 equivalents. |

#### Return value

The canonicalized url.

#### Remarks

This function performs such tasks as replacing unsafe characters with their escape sequences and collapsing sequences like "..\\...".

If a URL string contains "/../" or "/./", **AfxUrlCanonicalize** normally treats the characters as indicating navigation in the URL hierarchy. The function simplifies the URLs before combining them. For instance "/hello/cruel/../world" is simplified to "/hello/world". If the URL_DONT_SIMPLIFY flag is set in *dwFlags*, the function does not simplify URLs. In this case, "/hello/cruel/../world" is left as it is.

---

## AfxUrlCombine

When provided with a relative URL and its base, returns a URL in canonical form.

```
FUNCTION AfxUrlCombine (BYREF wszBase AS WSTRING, BYREF wszRelative AS WSTRING, BYVAL dwFlags AS DWORD) AS DWSTRING
```

| Parameter  | Description |
| ---------- | ----------- |
| *wszBase* | A string that contains the base url. |
| *wszRelative* | A string that contains the relative url. |
| *dwFlags* | Flags that specify how the URL is converted to canonical form. The flags can be combined. |

| Flag       | Description |
| ---------- | ----------- |
| URL_DONT_SIMPLIFY | Treat "/./" and "/../" in a URL string as literal characters, not as shorthand for navigation. See Remarks for further discussion. |
| URL_ESCAPE_PERCENT | Convert any occurrence of "%" to its escape sequence. |
| URL_ESCAPE_SPACES_ONLY | Replace only spaces with escape sequences. This flag takes precedence over URL_ESCAPE_UNSAFE, but does not apply to opaque URLs. |
| URL_ESCAPE_UNSAFE | Replace unsafe characters with their escape sequences. Unsafe characters are those characters that may be altered during transport across the Internet, and include the (<, >, ", #, {, }, \|, \\, ^, \[, ], and ') characters. This flag applies to all URLs, including opaque URLs. |
| URL_NO_META | Defined to be the same as URL_DONT_SIMPLIFY. |
| URL_PLUGGABLE_PROTOCOL | Combine URLs with client-defined pluggable protocols, according to the W3C specification. This flag does not apply to standard protocols such as ftp, http, gopher, and so on. If this flag is set, **AfxUrlCombine** does not simplify URLs, so there is no need to also set URL_DONT_SIMPLIFY. |
| URL_UNESCAPE | Un-escape any escape sequences that the URLs contain, with two exceptions. The escape sequences for "?" and "#" are not un-escaped. If one of the URL_ESCAPE_XXX flags is also set, the two URLs are first un-escaped, then combined, then escaped. |
| URL_ESCAPE_AS_UTF8 | Windows 7 and later. Percent-encode all non-ASCII characters as their UTF-8 equivalents. |

#### Return value

The canonicalized url.

#### Remarks

Items between slashes are treated as hierarchical identifiers; the last item specifies the document itself. You must enter a slash (/) after the document name to append more items; otherwise, **AfxUrlCombine** changes one document for another.

If a URL string contains '/../' or '/./', **AfxUrlCombine** usually treats the characters as if they indicated navigation in the URL hierarchy. The function simplifies the URLs before combining them. For instance, "/hello/cruel/../world" is simplified to "/hello/world". If the URL_DONT_SIMPLIFY flag is set in dwFlags, the function does not simplify URLs. In this case, "/hello/cruel/../world" is left as it is.

---

## AfxUrlCompare

Makes a case-sensitive comparison of two URL strings.

```
FUNCTION AfxUrlCompare (BYREF wszUrl1 AS CONST WSTRING, BYREF wszUrl2 AS CONST WSTRING, _
   BYVAL fIgnoreSlash AS LONG) AS LONG
```

| Parameter  | Description |
| ---------- | ----------- |
| *wszUrl1* | A string that contains the first URL. |
| *wszUrl2* | A string that contains the second URL. |
| *fIgnoreSlash* |  A value that is set to TRUE to have **AfxUrlCompare** ignore a trailing '/' character on either or both URLs. |

#### Return value

Returns zero if the two strings are equal. The function will also return zero if *fIgnoreSlash* is set to TRUE and one of the strings has a trailing '\\' character. The function returns a negative integer if the string pointed to by *wszUrl1* is less than the string pointed to by *wszUrl2*. Otherwise, it returns a positive integer.

#### Remarks

For best results, you should first canonicalize the URLs with **AfxUrlCanonicalize**. Then, compare the canonicalized URLs with **AfxUrlCompare**.

---

## AfxUrlCreateFromPath

Converts a Microsoft MS-DOS path to a canonicalized URL.

```
FUNCTION AfxUrlCreateFromPath (BYREF wszPath AS WSTRING) AS DWSTRING
```

| Parameter  | Description |
| ---------- | ----------- |
| *wszPath* | A string that contains the MS-DOS path. |

#### Return value

The canonicalized URL.

---

## AfxUrlEscape

Converts characters in a URL that might be altered during transport across the Internet ("unsafe" characters) into their corresponding escape sequences.

```
FUNCTION AfxUrlEscape (BYREF wszUrl AS WSTRING, BYVAL dwFlags AS DWORD) AS DWSTRING
```

| Parameter  | Description |
| ---------- | ----------- |
| *wszUrl* | A string that contains the MS-DOS path. |
| *dwFlags* | The flags that indicate which portion of the URL is being provided in *wszURL* and which characters in that string should be converted to their escape sequences. |

| Flag       | Description |
| ---------- | ----------- |
| URL_DONT_ESCAPE_EXTRA_INFO | Used only in conjunction with URL_ESCAPE_SPACES_ONLY to prevent the conversion of characters in the query (the portion of the URL following the first # or ? character encountered in the string). This flag should not be used alone, nor combined with URL_ESCAPE_SEGMENT_ONLY. |
| URL_BROWSER_MODE | Defined to be the same as URL_DONT_ESCAPE_EXTRA_INFO. |
| URL_ESCAPE_SPACES_ONLY | Convert only space characters to their escape sequences, including those space characters in the query portion of the URL. Other unsafe characters are not converted to their escape sequences. This flag assumes that *wszURL* does not contain a full URL. It expects only the portions following the server specification.<br>Combine this flag with URL_DONT_ESCAPE_EXTRA_INFO to prevent the conversion of space characters in the query portion of the URL.<br>This flag cannot be combined with URL_ESCAPE_PERCENT or URL_ESCAPE_SEGMENT_ONLY. |
| URL_ESCAPE_PERCENT | Convert any % character found in the segment section of the URL (that section falling between the server specification and the first # or ? character). By default, the % character is not converted to its escape sequence. Other unsafe characters in the segment are also converted normally.<br>Combining this flag with URL_ESCAPE_SEGMENT_ONLY includes those % characters in the query portion of the URL. However, as the URL_ESCAPE_SEGMENT_ONLY flag causes the entire string to be considered the segment, any # or ? characters are also converted.<br>This flag cannot be combined with URL_ESCAPE_SPACES_ONLY. |
| URL_ESCAPE_SEGMENT_ONLY | Indicates that *wszURL* contains only that section of the URL following the server component but preceding the query. All unsafe characters in the string are converted. If a full URL is provided when this flag is set, all unsafe characters in the entire string are converted, including # and ? characters.<br>Combine this flag with URL_ESCAPE_PERCENT to include that character in the conversion.<br>This flag cannot be combined with URL_ESCAPE_SPACES_ONLY or URL_DONT_ESCAPE_EXTRA_INFO. |
| URL_ESCAPE_AS_UTF8 | Windows 7 and later. Percent-encode all non-ASCII characters as their UTF-8 equivalents. |

#### Return value

The converted URL.

#### Remarks

For the purposes of this document, a typical URL is divided into three sections: the server, the segment, and the query. For example:

http://microsoft.com/test.asp?url=/example/abc.asp?frame=true#fragment

The server portion is "http://microsoft.com/". The trailing forward slash is considered part of the server portion.

The segment portion is any part of the path found following the server portion, but before the first # or ? character, in this case simply "test.asp".

The query portion is the remainder of the path from the first # or ? character (inclusive) to the end. In the example, it is "?url=/example/abc.asp?frame=true#fragment".

Unsafe characters are those characters that might be altered during transport across the Internet. This function converts unsafe characters into their equivalent "%xy" escape sequences. The following table shows unsafe characters and their escape sequences.

| Character  | Escape Sequence |
| ---------- | ----------- |
| ^ | %5E5E |
| & | %26 |
| ` | %60 |
| { | %7B |
| } | %7D |

Use of the URL_ESCAPE_SEGMENT_ONLY flag also causes the conversion of the # (%23), ? (%3F), and / (%2F) characters.

By default, AfxUrlEscape ignores any text following a # or ? character. The URL_ESCAPE_SEGMENT_ONLY flag overrides this behavior by regarding the entire string as the segment. The URL_ESCAPE_SPACES_ONLY flag overrides this behavior, but only for space characters.

Security Warning: This function should be called from client applications only.

## AfxUrlEscapeSpaces

Converts space characters into their corresponding escape sequence.

```
FUNCTION AfxUrlEscapeSpaces (BYREF wszUrl AS WSTRING) AS DWSTRING
```

| Parameter  | Description |
| ---------- | ----------- |
| *wszUrl* | A string that contains the URL to be corrected. This string must not exceed INTERNET_MAX_PATH_LENGTH characters in length, including the terminating NULL character. |

#### Return value

The converted URL.

---

## AfxUrlFixup

Attempts to correct a URL whose protocol identifier is incorrect. For example, htttp will be changed to http.

```
FUNCTION AfxUrlFixup (BYREF wszUrl AS WSTRING) AS DWSTRING
```

| Parameter  | Description |
| ---------- | ----------- |
| *wszUrl* | A string that contains the URL to be corrected. This string must not exceed INTERNET_MAX_PATH_LENGTH characters in length, including the terminating NULL character. |

#### Return value

The converted URL.

#### Remarks

The **AfxUrlFixup** function recognizes the schemes specified by the URL_SCHEME enumeration.

Priority is given to the first character in the protocol identifier section so htp will be converted to http instead of ftp.

**Notes**

Do not use this function for deterministic data transformation. The heuristics used by **AfxUrlFixup** can change from one release to the next. The function should only be used to correct possibly invalid user input.

This function is available through Windows 7 and Windows Server 2008. It might be altered or unavailable in subsequent versions of Windows.

## AfxUrlHash

Hashes a URL string.

```
FUNCTION AfxUrlHash (BYREF wszUrl AS WSTRING, BYVAL pbHash AS BYTE PTR, _
   BYVAL cbHash AS DWORD) AS HRESULT
```

| Parameter  | Description |
| ---------- | ----------- |
| *wszUrl* | A string that contains the URL. This string must not exceed INTERNET_MAX_PATH_LENGTH characters in length, including the terminating NULL character. |

# DSAFEARRAY Class

`DSAFEARRAY` is a class that provides wrapper methods for the `SAFEARRAY` structure, making it easy to create and manage single- and multidimensional arrays of almost any of the `VARIANT`-supported types. The lower bound of a `DSAFEARRAY` can start at any user-defined value. Additional overloaded methods are provided for one and two-dimensional safe arrays, that are the ones most often used in COM programming.

When the class is destroyed, the array descriptor and all of the data in the array is destroyed. If objects are stored in the array, **IUnknown_Release** is called on each object in the array. Safe arrays of variants will have **VariantClear** called on each member and safe arrays of **BSTR** will have **SysFreeString** called on each element. **IRecordInfo.RecordClear** will be called to release object references and other values of a record without deallocating the record.

## <a name="safearray"></a>SAFEARRAY Structure

Represents a safe array.

```
TYPE tagSAFEARRAY
   cDims as USHORT
   fFeatures as USHORT
   cbElements as ULONG
   cLocks as ULONG
   pvData as PVOID
   rgsabound(0 to 0) as SAFEARRAYBOUND
EBD TYPE
```

| Member     | Description |
| ---------- | ----------- |
| **cDims** | Count of dimensions of the array. |
| **fFeatures** | Flags. |
| **cbElements** | Size of an element of the array. |
| **cLocks** | Number of times the array has been locked without corresponding unlock. |
| **pvData** | Pointer to the data. |
| **rgsabound** | One bound for each dimension. |

#### fFeatures Flags

| Flag       | Description |
| ---------- | ----------- |
| FADF_AUTO | An array that is allocated on the stack. |
| FADF_STATIC | An array that is statically allocated. |
| FADF_EMBEDDED | An array that is embedded in a structure. |
| FADF_FIXEDSIZE | An array that may not be resized or reallocated. |
| FADF_RECORD | An array that contains records. When set, there will be a pointer to the IRecordinfo interface at negative offset 4 in the array descriptor. |
| FADF_HAVEIID | An array that has an IID identifying interface. When set, there will be a GUID at negative offset 16 in the safe array descriptor. Flag is set only when FADF_DISPATCH or FADF_UNKNOWN is also set. |
| FADF_HAVEVARTYPE | An array that has a VT type. When set, there will be a VT tag at negative offset 4 in the array descriptor that specifies the element type. |
| FADF_BSTR | An array of BSTRs. |
| FADF_UNKNOWN | An array of IUnknown pointers. |
| FADF_DISPATCH | An array of IDispatch pointers. |
| FADF_VARIANT | An array of VARIANTs. |
| FADF_RESERVED | Bits reserved for future use. |

#### Remarks

The array rgsabound is stored with the left-most dimension in rgsabound[0] and the right-most dimension in rgsabound(cDims - 1).

The **fFeatures** flags describe attributes of an array that can affect how the array is released. The fFeatures field describes what type of data is stored in the SAFEARRAY and how the array is allocated. This allows freeing the array without referencing its containing variant. The bits are accessed using the following constants:

#### Thread Safety

All public static members of the SAFEARRAY data type are thread safe. Instance members are not guaranteed to be thread safe.

For example, consider an application that uses the SafeArrayLock and SafeArrayUnlock functions. If these functions are called concurrently from different threads on the same SAFEARRAY data type instance, an inconsistent lock count may be created. This will eventually cause the SafeArrayUnlock function to return E_UNEXPECTED. You can prevent this by providing your own synchronization code.

   lLbound as LONG
END TYPE
```

| Member     | Description |

```

| Parameter  | Description |

## <a name="createvector"></a>CreateVector

Creates a fixed size safe array from the given VARTYPE, lower bound and number of elements.

```
FUNCTION CreateVector (BYVAL vt AS VARTYPE, BYVAL cElements AS ULONG, BYVAL lLBound AS LONG) AS HRESULT
```

| Parameter  | Description |
| ---------- | ----------- |
| *vt* | The base type of the array (the VARTYPE of each element of the array). The VARTYPE is restricted to a subset of the variant types. Neither the VT_ARRAY nor the VT_BYREF flag can be set. VT_EMPTY and VT_NULL are not valid base types for the array. All other types are legal. |
| *cElements* | The number of elements in the array. |
| *lLBound* | The lower bound for the array. Can be negative. |

#### Return value

S_OK (0) on success or an HRESULT code on failure.

#### Remarks

**CreateVector** allocates a single block of memory containing a **SAFEARRAY** structure for a single-dimension array (24 bytes), immediately followed by the array data. All of the existing safe array functions work correctly for safe arrays that are allocated with **CreateVector**.

A safe array created with **CreateVector** is allocated as a single block of memory. Both the SafeArray descriptor and the array data block are allocated contiguously in one allocation, which speeds up array allocation. However, a user can allocate the descriptor and data area separately using the **SafeArrayAllocDescriptor** and **SafeArrayAllocData*** calls.

#### Usage example

```
DIM dsa AS DSAFEARRAY
dsa.CreateVector(VT_VARIANT, 1000, 1)
FOR i AS LONG = 1 TO 1000
   dsa.PutVar(i, "Test string " & WSTR(i))
NEXT
```

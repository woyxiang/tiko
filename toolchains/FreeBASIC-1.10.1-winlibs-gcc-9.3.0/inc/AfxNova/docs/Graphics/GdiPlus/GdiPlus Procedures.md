# INFO: Interoperability Between GDI and GDI+

INFO: Interoperability Between GDI and GDI+

SUMMARY

It is sometimes desirable to mix GDI and GDI+ drawing operations in the same code path. There are some caveats to keep in mind when you are writing code that allows GDI and GDI+ to interoperate. This article outlines those caveats and provides additional information to help you successfully write such code.

MORE INFORMATION

While it is permissible to mix GDI and GDI+ code, there are certain rules that must be followed. Generally, you should not interleave GDI and GDI+ calls on one target object. For example, it is okay to wrap a Graphics object around an HDC, but you should not access the HDC directly from GDI until the Graphics object is destroyed.

Four primary scenarios for interoperability between GDI and GDI+ are covered in this article:

* Using GDI on a GDI+ Graphics object backed by the screen
* Using GDI on a GDI+ Graphics object backed by a bitmap
* Using GDI+ on a GDI HDC
* Using GDI+ on a GDI memory HBITMAP

### Using GDI on a GDI+ Graphics Object Backed by the Screen

One example of a need to use GDI on a GDI+ Graphics object backed by the screen would be to draw a "rubber band" or "focus" rectangle. GDI+ currently has no direct support for raster operations (ROPs), so GDI must be used directly if R2_XOR pen operations are required. In this case, you would use GdipGetDC to obtain an HDC to which the GDI output would be directed. GDI+ output should not be attempted on the Graphics object for the life of the HDC (that is, until GdipReleaseDC is called).

### Using GDI on a GDI+ Graphics Object Backed by a Bitmap

When GdipGetDC is called for a Graphics object that is backed by a bitmap rather than the screen, a memory HDC is created and a new HBITMAP is created and selected into the memory HDC. This new memory bitmap is not initialized with the original bitmap's image but rather with a sentinel pattern, which allows GDI+ to track changes to the bitmap. Any changes that are made to the memory bitmap through the use of GDI code become apparent in changes to the sentinel pattern. When GdipReleaseDC is called, those changes are copied back to the original bitmap. Because the memory bitmap is not initialized with the bitmap's image, an HDC that is obtained in this way should be considered "write only" and is therefore not suitable for use with ROPs, the use of which requires the ability to read the target, like R2_XOR. Also, there is a performance cost to this approach because GDI+ must copy the changes back to the original bitmap.

### Using GDI+ on a GDI HDC

You can facilitate the use of GDI+ on an HDC by using the Graphics constructor that takes an HDC as a parameter. The drawing members of the Graphics class can be used to draw on the HDC in this way. Once the Graphics object is attached to the HDC, no GDI operations should be performed on the HDC until the Graphics object is destroyed or goes out of scope. If GDI output is required on the HDC, either destroy the Graphics object before using the original HDC or use GdipGetDC to get a new HDC and then follow the rules described earlier in this article for interoperability while using GDI on a GDI+ object.

Using GDI+ on a GDI Memory HBITMAP

The GDI+ Bitmap constructor that takes an HBITMAP as a parameter does not use the actual source HBITMAP as the backing image for the bitmap. Rather, a copy of the image is made in the constructor, and changes are not written back to the original bitmap, even during execution of the destructor. The new bitmap can be thought of as "copy on creation," so to get GDI+ to draw on a memory HBITMAP from GDI and have the changes apply to the HBITMAP, an approach like the following is needed instead:

1. Create a DIBSection.
2. Select the DIBSection into a memory HDC.
3. To use GDI+ to draw to the DIBSection, wrap a Graphics object around the HDC.
4. To use GDI to draw to/from the DIBSection, destroy the Graphics object, and use the HDC.
5. Destroy the Graphics objects, and then clear the DIBSection selection from the HDC.

Later, a bitmap can be constructed from the DIBSection and used as a source image in GdipDrawImage if needed.

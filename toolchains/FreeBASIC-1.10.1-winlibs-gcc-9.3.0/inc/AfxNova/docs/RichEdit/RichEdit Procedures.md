## RichEdit_AutoUrlDetect

Enables or disables automatic detection of URLs by a rich edit control.

```
FUNCTION RichEdit_AutoUrlDetect (BYVAL hRichEdit AS HWND, BYVAL fUrlDetect AS LONG) AS LONG
```

| Parameter  | Description |
| ---------- | ----------- |
| *hRichEdit* | The handle of the rich edit control. |
| *fUrlDetect* | Specify 0 to disable automatic link detection, or one of the following values to enable various kinds of detection. |

| fUrlDetect value  | Description |
| --------------- | ----------- |
| AURL_DISABLEMIXEDLGC | **Windows 8**: Disable recognition of domain names that contain labels with characters belonging to more than one of the following scripts: Latin, Greek, and Cyrillic. |
| AURL_ENABLEDRIVELETTERS | **Windows 8**: Recognize file names that have a leading drive specification, such as c:\temp. |
| AURL_ENABLEEA | This value is deprecated; use **AURL_ENABLEEAURLS** instead. |
| AURL_ENABLEEAURLS | Recognize URLs that contain East Asian characters. |
| AURL_ENABLEEMAILADDR | **Windows 8**: Recognize email addresses. |
| AURL_ENABLETELNO | **Windows 8**: Recognize telephone numbers. |
| AURL_ENABLEURL | **Windows 8**: Recognize URLs that include the path. |

#### Return value

If the message succeeds, the return value is zero.

If the message fails, the return value is a nonzero value. For example, the message might fail due to insufficient memory or an invalid detection option.

#### Remarks

If automatic URL detection is enabled (that is, *fUrlDetect* includes **AURL_ENABLEURL**), the rich edit control scans any modified text to determine whether the text matches the format of a URL (or more generally in Windows 8 or later an IRI International Resource Identifier). The control detects URLs that begin with the following scheme names:

- callto
- file
- ftp
- gopher
- http
- https
- mailto
- news
- notes
- nntp
- onenote
- outlook
- prospero
- tel
- telnet
- wais
- webcal

When automatic link detection is enabled, the rich edit control removes the **CFE_LINK** effect from modified text that does not have a format recognized by the control. If your application uses the **CFE_LINK** effect to mark other types of text, do not enable automatic link detection. The rich edit control does not check whether a detected link exists; that responsibility belongs to the client.

A rich edit control sends the [EN_LINK](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/controls/en-link) notification when it receives various messages while the mouse pointer is over text that has the **CFE_LINK** effect. 

---

## RichEdit_CallAutocorrectProc

Calls the autocorrect callback function that is stored by the **RichEdit_SetAutocorrectProc** message, provided that the text preceding the insertion point is a candidate for autocorrection.

```
FUNCTION RichEdit_CallAutocorrectProc (BYVAL hRichEdit AS HWND, BYVAL char AS WCHAR) AS LONG
```

| Parameter  | Description |
| ---------- | ----------- |
| *hRichEdit* | The handle of the rich edit control. |
| *char* | A character of type **WCHAR**. If this character is a tab (U+0009), and the character preceding the insertion point isn't a tab, then the character preceding the insertion point is treated as part of the autocorrect candidate string instead of as a string delimiter; otherwise, *char* has no effect. |

#### Return value

The return value is zero if the message succeeds, or nonzero if an error occurs.

---

## RichEdit_CanPaste

Determines whether a rich edit control can paste a specified clipboard format.

```
FUNCTION RichEdit_CanPaste (BYVAL hRichEdit AS HWND, BYVAL clipformat AS LONG) AS LONG

```
FUNCTION RichEdit_CanRedo (BYVAL hRichEdit AS HWND) AS LONG
```
| Parameter  | Description |
| ---------- | ----------- |
| *hRichEdit* | The handle of the rich edit control. |

#### Return value

If there are actions in the control redo queue, the return value is a nonzero value.

If the redo queue is empty, the return value is zero.

---

## RichEdit_CanUndo

Determines whether there are any actions in the rich edit control undo queue.

```
FUNCTION RichEdit_CanUndo (BYVAL hRichEdit AS HWND) AS LONG
```
| Parameter  | Description |
| ---------- | ----------- |
| *hRichEdit* | The handle of the rich edit control. |

#### Return value

If there are actions in the control's undo queue, the return value is nonzero.

If the undo queue is empty, the return value is zero.

---

## RichEdit_CharFromPos

```
| Parameter  | Description |
| ---------- | ----------- |
| *hRichEdit* | The handle of the rich edit control. |
| *lppl* | A pointer to a [POINTL](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/api/windef/ns-windef-pointl) structure that contains the horizontal and vertical coordinates of a point in the control's client area. The coordinates are in screen units and are relative to the upper-left corner of the control's client area. |

#### Return value

The return value specifies the zero-based character index of the character nearest the specified point. The return value indicates the last character in the edit control if the specified point is beyond the last character in the control.

---

## RichEdit_DisplayBand

Displays a portion of the contents of a rich edit control, as previously formatted for a device using the [EM_FORMATRANGE]([url](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/controls/em-formatrange)) message.

```
FUNCTION RichEdit_DisplayBand (BYVAL hRichEdit AS HWND, BYVAL lprc AS RECT PTR) AS LONG
```
| Parameter  | Description |
| ---------- | ----------- |
| *hRichEdit* | The handle of the rich edit control. |
| *lprc* | A pointer to a [RECT](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/api/windef/ns-windef-rect) structure specifying the display area of the device. |

#### Return value

If the operation succeeds, the return value is **TRUE**.

If the operation fails, the return value is **FALSE**.

#### Remarks

Text and Component Object Model (COM) objects are clipped by the rectangle. The application does not need to set the clipping region.

Banding is the process by which a single page of output is generated using one or more separate rectangles, or bands. When all bands are placed on the page, a complete image results. This approach is often used by raster printers that do not have sufficient memory or ability to image a full page at one time. Banding devices include most dot matrix printers as well as some laser printers.

| **SES_USECTF** | **Windows XP with SP1**: Turns on TSF support. (default: 0). |
| **SES_XLTCRCRLFTOCR** | Turns on translation of CRCRLFs to CRs. When this bit is on and a file is read in, all instances of CRCRLF will be converted to hard CRs internally. This will affect the text wrapping. Note that if such a file is saved as plain text, the CRs will be replaced by CRLFs. This is the .txt standard for plain text (default: 0, which deletes CRCRLFs on input). |

## RichEdit_GetLangOptions

Retrieves a rich edit control's option settings for Input Method Editor (IME) and Asian language support.

```
FUNCTION RichEdit_GetLangOptions (BYVAL hRichEdit AS HWND) AS DWORD
```
| Parameter  | Description |
| ---------- | ----------- |
| *hRichEdit* | The handle of the rich edit control. |

#### Return value

Returns the IME and Asian language settings, which can be zero or more of the following values.

| Return code  | Description |
| ------------ | ----------- |
| **IMF_AUTOFONT** | If this flag is set, the control automatically changes fonts when the user explicitly changes to a different keyboard layout. It is useful to turn off **IMF_AUTOFONT** for universal Unicode fonts. This option is turned on by default (1). |
| **IMF_AUTOFONTSIZEADJUST** | If this flag is set, the control scales font-bound font sizes from insertion point size according to script. For example, Asian fonts are slightly larger than Western ones. This option is turned on by default (1). |
| **IMF_AUTOKEYBOARD** | If this flag is set, the control automatically changes the keyboard layout when the user explicitly changes to a different font, or when the user explicitly changes the insertion point to a new location in the text. Will be turned on automatically for bidirectional controls. For all other controls, it is turned off by default. This option is turned off by default (0). |
| **IMF_DISABLEAUTOBIDIAUTOKEYBOARD** | **Windows 8**: If this flag is set, the control uses language neutral logic for automatic keyboard switching. This option is turned off by default (0). |
| **IMF_DUALFONT** | If this flag is set, the control uses dual-font mode. Used for Asian language support. The control uses an English font for ASCII text and a Asian font for Asian text. This option is turned on by default (1). |
| **IMF_IMEALWAYSSENDNOTIFY** | This flag controls how the rich edit control notifies the client during IME composition:<br>0: No **EN_CHANGE** or **EN_SELCHANGE** notifications during undetermined state. Send notification when the final string comes in. This is the default.<br>1: Send **EN_CHANGE** and **EN_SELCHANGE** events during undetermined state. |
| **IMF_IMECANCELCOMPLETE** | This flag determines how the control uses the composition string of an IME if the user cancels it. If this flag is set, the control discards the composition string. If this flag is not set, the control uses the composition string as the result string. This option is turned off by default (0). |
| **IMF_NOIMPLICITLANG** | **Windows 8**: If this flag is set, disable stamping keyboard input with the keyboard language and ensuring that non-East Asian language IDss are compatible with the character repertoire. This option is turned off by default (0). |
| **IMF_NOKBDLIDFIXUP** | **Windows 8**: If this flag is set, the rich edit control disables stamping keyboard language on an empty control. This option is turned off by default (0). |
| **IMF_SPELLCHECKING** | **Windows 8**: If this flag is set, the rich edit control turns on spell checking. This option is turned off by default (0). |
| **IMF_TKBAUTOCORRECTION** | **Windows 8**: If this flag is set, enable touch keyboard autocorrect. This option is turned off by default (0). |
| **IMF_TKBPREDICTION** | **Windows 10**: Ignored.<br>**Windows 8**: If this flag is set, the rich edit control enables touch keyboard prediction. This option is turned off by default (0). |
| **IMF_UIFONTS** | Use user-interface default fonts. This option is turned off by default (0). |

#### Remarks

The **IMF_AUTOFONT** flag is set by default. The **IMF_AUTOKEYBOARD** and **IMF_IMECANCELCOMPLETE** flags are cleared by default.

FUNCTION RichEdit_GetLimitText (BYVAL hRichEdit AS HWND) AS LONG
```
| Parameter  | Description |
| ---------- | ----------- |
| *hRichEdit* | The handle of the rich edit control. |

#### Return value

The return value is the text limit.

#### Remarks

The text limit is the maximum amount of text, in characters, that the control can contain. For ANSI text, this is the number of bytes; for Unicode text, this is the number of characters. Two documents with the same character limit will yield the same text limit, even if one is ANSI and the other is Unicode.

---

## RichEdit_GetLine

Copies a line of text from a rich edit control.

```
FUNCTION RichEdit_GetLine (BYVAL hRichEdit AS HWND, BYVAL which AS DWORD) AS DWSTRING
```

This point will be the point that is currently located in the upper-left corner of the edit control window. |

#### Remarks

The values returned in the [POINT](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/api/windef/ns-windef-point) structure are 16-bit values (even in the 32-bit wide fields).

---

## RichEdit_GetSel

Retrieves the starting and ending character positions of the current selection in a rich edit control.

```
FUNCTION RichEdit_GetSel (BYVAL hRichEdit AS HWND, BYVAL pdwStartPos AS DWORD PTR, BYVAL pdwEndPos AS DWORD PTR) AS LONG
```

| Parameter  | Description |
| ---------- | ----------- |
| *hRichEdit* | The handle of the rich edit control. |
| *pdwStartPos* | A pointer to a **DWORD** value that receives the starting position of the selection. This parameter can be **NULL**. |
| *pdwEndPos* | A pointer to a **DWORD** value that receives the position of the first unselected character after the end of the selection. This parameter can be **NULL**. |

#### Return value

The return value is a zero-based value with the starting position of the selection in the **LOWORD** and the position of the first character after the last selected character in the **HIWORD**. If either of these values exceeds 65,535, the return value is -1.

It is better to use the values returned in *pdwStartPos* and *pdwEndPos* because they are full 32-bit values.

#### Remarks

If there is no selection, the starting and ending values are both the position of the caret.

You can also use the **EM_EXGETSEL** message to retrieve the same information. **EM_EXGETSEL** also returns starting and ending character positions as 32-bit values. A combination of the use of **EM_EXGETSEL** and **EM_GETSELTEXT** are used in the **RichEdit_GetSelText** function to retrieve the selected text as a **DWSTRING**.

---

## RichEdit_GetSelText

#### Return value

Returns S_OK if successful, or one of the following error codes.

| Return code  | Description |
| ------------ | ----------- |
| **E_FAIL** | Changes cannot be made. This can occur if the control is a plain-text or single-line control, or if the insertion point is inside a math object. It also occurs if tables are disabled if the **RichEdit_SetEditStyleEx** message sets the **SES_EX_NOTABLE** value. |
| **E_INVALIDARG** | The *lptp* or *lptcp* parameters are NULL or point to an invalid structure. The **cbRow** member of the **TABLEROWPARMS** structure must equal sizeof(TABLEROWPARMS) or sizeof(TABLEROWPARMS) 2*sizeof(long). The latter value is the size of the RichEdit 4.1 **TABLEROWPARMS** structure. The **cbCell** member of the **TABLEROWPARMS** structure must equal sizeof(TABLECELLPARMS). The query character position must be at a table row delimiter. |

The character position specified by the **cpStartRow** member of the **TABLEROWPARMS** structure should be at the start of the table row, or at the end delimiter of the table row. If **cpStartRow** is set to 1, the character position is given by the current selection. In this case, position the selection at the end of the row (between the cell mark and the end delimiter of the table row), or select the row.

---

## RichEdit_GetText

Retrieves the text from a rich edit control.

```
FUNCTION RichEdit_GetText (BYVAL hRichEdit AS HWND) AS DWSTRING
```

| Parameter  | Description |
| ---------- | ----------- |
| *hRichEdit* | The handle of the rich edit control. |

#### Remarks

The Windows API function **GetWindowTextW** can also be used to retrive the text of a rich edit control, but it cannot retrieve the text of a control in another application.

---

## RichEdit_GetTextEx

Retrieves all of the text from the rich edit control in any particular code base you want.

```
FUNCTION RichEdit_GetTextEx (BYVAL hRichEdit AS HWND, BYVAL lpgtex AS GETTEXTEX PTR, BYVAL buffer AS ANY PTR) AS DWORD
```

| Parameter  | Description |
| ---------- | ----------- |
| *hRichEdit* | The handle of the rich edit control. |
| *lpgtex* | Pointer to a [GETTEXTEX](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/api/richedit/ns-richedit-gettextex) structure, which indicates how to translate the text before putting it into the output buffer. |
| *buffer* | Pointer to the buffer to receive the text. The size of this buffer, in bytes, is specified by the *cb* member of the [GETTEXTEX](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/api/richedit/ns-richedit-gettextex) structure. Use the **RichEdit_GetTextLength** message to get the required size of the buffer. |

#### Return value

The return value is the number of characters copied into the output buffer, not including the null terminator.

#### Remarks

If the size of the output buffer is less than the size of the text in the control, the edit control will copy text from its beginning and place it in the buffer until the buffer is full. A terminating null character will still be placed at the end of the buffer.

---

## RichEdit_GetTextLength

Retrieves the length of all text in a rich edit control.

```
FUNCTION RichEdit_GetTextLength (BYVAL hRichEdit AS HWND) AS LONG
```

| Parameter  | Description |
| ---------- | ----------- |
| *hRichEdit* | The handle of the rich edit control. |

#### Return value

The return value is the length of the text in characters, not including the terminating null character.

#### Remarks

When the **WM_GETTEXTLENGTH** message is sent, the **DefWindowProc** function returns the length, in characters, of the text. Under certain conditions, the **DefWindowProc** function returns a value that is larger than the actual length of the text. This occurs with certain mixtures of ANSI and Unicode, and is due to the system allowing for the possible existence of double-byte character set (DBCS) characters within the text. The return value, however, will always be at least as large as the actual length of the text; you can thus always use it to guide buffer allocation. This behavior can occur when an application uses both ANSI functions and common dialogs, which use Unicode.

To retrieve the text, you can also use the **AfxGetWindowText** function, the **WM_GETTEXT** message, or the Windows API **GetWindowTextW** function.

---

## RichEdit_GetTextLengthEx

Calculates text length in various ways. It is usually called before creating a buffer to receive the text from the control.

```
FUNCTION RichEdit_GetTextLengthEx (BYVAL hRichEdit AS HWND, BYVAL lpgtex AS GETTEXTLENGTHEX PTR) AS LONG
```

| Parameter  | Description |
| ---------- | ----------- |
| *hRichEdit* | The handle of the rich edit control. |
| *lpgtex* | Pointer to a [GETTEXTLENGTHEX](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/api/richedit/ns-richedit-gettextlengthex) structure that receives the text length information. |

#### Return value

The message returns the number of characters in the edit control, depending on the setting of the flags in the [GETTEXTLENGTHEX](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/api/richedit/ns-richedit-gettextlengthex) structure. If incompatible flags were set in the *flags* member, the message returns **E_INVALIDARG**.

#### Remarks

This message is a fast and easy way to determine the number of characters in the Unicode version of the rich edit control. However, for a non-Unicode target code page you will potentially be converting to a combination of single-byte and double-byte characters.

---

| **TM_SINGLELEVELUNDO**  |   4   | The control allows the user to undo only the last action in the undo queue. |
| **TM_MULTILEVELUNDO** |   8   | The control supports multiple undo actions. This is the default setting. Use the *RichEdit_SetUndoLimit* message to set the maximum number of undo actions. |
| **TM_SINGLECODEPAGE** |  16   | The control only allows the English keyboard and a keyboard corresponding to the default character set. For example, you could have Greek and English. Note that this prevents Unicode text from entering the control. For example, use this value if a Rich Edit control must be restricted to ANSI text. |
| **TM_MULTICODEPAGE** |  32   | The control allows multiple code pages and Unicode text into the control. This is the default setting. |

---

```
FUNCTION RichEdit_GetUndoName (BYVAL hRichEdit AS HWND) AS DWORD
```

| Parameter  | Description |
| ---------- | ----------- |
| *hRichEdit* | The handle of the rich edit control. |

#### Return value

If there is an undo action, the value returned is an [UNDONAMEID](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/api/richedit/ne-richedit-undonameid) enumeration value that indicates the type of the next action in the control's undo queue.

If there are no actions that can be undone or the type of the next undo action is unknown, the return value is zero.

#### UNDONAMEID enumeration

## RichEdit_InsertTable

Inserts one or more identical table rows with empty cells.

```
FUNCTION RichEdit_InsertTable (BYVAL hRichEdit AS HWND, BYVAL lptp AS TABLEROWPARMS PTR, _
   BYVAL lptcp AS TABLECELLPARMS PTR) AS DWORD
```
| Parameter  | Description |
| ---------- | ----------- |
| *hRichEdit* | The handle of the rich edit control. |
| *lptp* | A pointer to a [TABLEROWPARMS](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/api/richedit/ns-richedit-tablerowparms) structure. |
| *lptcp* | A pointer to a [TABLECELLPARMS](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/api/richedit/ns-richedit-tablecellparms) structure. |

#### Return value

Returns **S_OK** if the table is inserted, or an error code if not.

#### Remarks

If the **cpStartRow** member of the **TABLEROWPARMS** is –1, this message deletes the selected text (if any), and then inserts empty table rows with the row and cell parameters given by *lptp^* and *lptcp*. It leaves the selection pointing to the start of the first cell in the first row. The client can then populate the table cells by pointing the selection (or an **ITextRange**) to the various cell end marks and inserting and formatting the desired text. Such text can include nested table rows. Alternatively, if the **cpStartRow** member of the **TABLEROWPARMS** is 0 or greater, table rows are inserted at the character position given by **cpStartRow**. This only changes the current selection if the table is inserted inside the selected text.

A Microsoft Rich Edit table consists of a sequence of table rows which, in turn, consist of sequences of paragraphs. A table row starts with the special two-character delimiter paragraph U+FFF9 U+000D and ends with the two-character delimiter paragraph U+FFFB U+000D. Each cell is terminated by the cell mark U+0007, which is treated as a hard end-of-paragraph mark just as U+000D (CR) is. The table row and cell parameters are treated as special paragraph formatting of the table-row delimiters. The formatting contains the information in the **TABLEROWPARMS** structure. The cell parameters given by the **TABLECELLPARMS** structure are stored in an expanded version of the tabs array. This format allows tables to be nested within other tables, up to fifteen levels deep.

---

## RichEdit_IsIME

```

| Parameter  | Description |
| ---------- | ----------- |
| *hRichEdit* | The handle of the rich edit control. |
| *chMax* | The maximum number of characters the user can enter. If this parameter is zero, the text length is set to 64,000 characters. |

#### Return value

This message does not return a value.

#### Remarks

The **RichEdit_LimitText** message limits only the text the user can enter. It does not affect any text already in the edit control when the message is sent, nor does it affect the length of the text copied to the edit control by the **RichEdit_SetText** message. If an application uses the **RichEdit_SetTExt** message to place more text into an edit control than is specified in the **RichEdit_LimitText** message, the user can edit the entire contents of the edit control.

#### Note

**RichEdit_LimitText** ad **RichEdit_SetLimitText** are the same message.

---

| **SCF_SELECTION** | Applies the formatting to the current selection. If the selection is empty, the character formatting is applied to the insertion point, and the new character format is in effect only until the insertion point changes. |
| **SPF_SETDEFAULT** | Sets the default paragraph formatting attributes. |
| **SCF_SMARTFONT** | Apply the font only if it can handle script. |
| **SCF_USEUIRULES** | **RichEdit 4.1**: Used with **SCF_SELECTION**. Indicates that format came from a toolbar or other UI tool, so UI formatting rules should be used instead of literal formatting. |
| **SCF_WORD** | Applies the formatting to the selected word or words. If the selection is empty but the insertion point is inside a word, the formatting is applied to the word. The **SCF_WORD** value must be used in conjunction with the **SCF_SELECTION** value. |

#### Return value

If the operation succeeds, the return value is a nonzero value.

If the operation fails, the return value is zero.

#### Remarks

If this message is sent more than once with the same parameters, the effect on the text is toggled. That is, sending the message once produces the effect, sending the message twice cancels the effect, and so forth.

| **SES_EX_USESINGLELINE** | Enable a multiline control to act like a single-line control with the ability to scroll vertically when the single-line height is greater than the window height (default: 0). |
| **SES_HIDETEMPFORMAT** | Hide temporary formatting that is created when **ITextFont.Reset** is called with **tomApplyTmp**. For example, such formatting is used by spell checkers to display a squiggly underline under possibly misspelled words. |
| **SES_EX_USEMOUSEWPARAM** | Use *wParam* when handling the **WM_MOUSEMOVE** message and do not call **GetAsyncKeyState**. |

#### Return value

The return value is the state of the edit style flags after the rich edit control has attempted to implement your edit style changes. The edit style flags are a set of flags that indicate the current edit style.

---

## RichEdit_SetEllipsisMode

Sets the current ellipsis mode. When enabled, an ellipsis ( ) is displayed for text that doesn't fit in the display window. The ellipsis is only used when the control isn't active. When active, scroll bars are used to reveal text that doesn't fit into the display window.

## RichEdit_SetFontSize

Sets the font size for the selected text.

```
FUNCTION RichEdit_SetFontSize (BYVAL hRichEdit AS HWND, BYVAL ptsize AS LONG) AS LONG
```

| Parameter  | Description |
| ---------- | ----------- |
| *hRichEdit* | The handle of the rich edit control. |
| *ptsize* | Change in point size of the selected text. The result will be rounded according to values shown in the following table. This parameter should be in the range of -1637 to 1638. The resulting font size will be within the range of 1 to 1638. |

#### Return value

If no error occurred, the return value is TRUE.

If an error occurred, the return value is FALSE.

#### Remarks

You can easily get the font size by sending the **RichdEdit_GetCharFormat** message.

Rich Edit first adds *ptsize* to the current font size and then uses the resulting size and the following table to determine the rounding value.

| Band  | Rounding value |
| ----- | ----------- |
| <=12 | 1 |
| 28 | 2 |
| 36 | 0 |
| 48 | 0 |
| 72 | 0 |
| 80 | 0 |
| 80 | 10 |

If the resulting font size is not evenly divisible by the rounding value, the font size is then rounded to a number evenly divisible by the rounding value. So if the font size is less than or equal to 12, the rounding value will be 1. Similarly, if the font size is less than or equal to 28, the rounding value is 2. For values greater than 28, font sizes are rounded to the next band. So, the font size jumps to 36, 48, 72, 80. After 80, all rounding is done in increments of ten points.

The font size is rounded up or down depending on the sign of *ptsize*. If *ptsize* is positive, the rounding is always up. Otherwise, rounding is always down. So, if the current font size is 10 and *ptsize* is 3, the resulting font size would be 14 (10 + 3 = 13, which is not divisible by 2, so the size rounds up to 14). Conversely, if the current font size is 14 and *ptsize* is -3, the resulting font size would be 10 (14 - 3 = 11, which is not divisible by 2, so the size rounds down to 10).

The change is applied to each part of the selection. So, if some of the text is 10pt and some 20pt, after a call with *ptsize* set to 1, the font sizes become 11pt and 22pt, respectively.

Additional examples are shown in the following table.

| Original font size  | ptsize | Resulting font size |
| ------------------- | ------ | ------------------- |
| 7 | 1 | 8 |
| 7 | 3 | 10 |
| 10 | 3 | 14 |
| 14 | -3 | 10 |
| 28 | 1 | 36 |
| 28 | 3 | 36 |
| 80 | 1 | 90 |
| 80 | -1 | 72 |

## RichEdit_SetRect

Sets the formatting rectangle of a multiline rich edit control.

```
SUB RichEdit_SetRect (BYVAL hRichEdit AS HWND, BYVAL fCoord AS LONG, BYVAL prect AS RECT PTR)
```

| Parameter  | Description |
| ---------- | ----------- |
| *hRichEdit* | The handle of the rich edit control. |
| *fCoord* | **Rich Edit 2.0 and later**: Indicates whether *prect* specifies absolute or relative coordinates. A value of zero indicates absolute coordinates. A value of 1 indicates offsets relative to the current formatting rectangle. (The offsets can be positive or negative.)<br>**Edit controls and Rich Edit 1.0**: This parameter is not used and must be zero. |
| *prect* | A pointer to a [RECT](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/api/windef/ns-windef-rect) structure that specifies the new dimensions of the rectangle. If this parameter is **NULL**, the formatting rectangle is set to its default values. |

#### Remarks

Setting *prect* to **NULL** has no effect if a touch device is installed, or if **EM_SETRECT** is sent from a thread that has a hook installed (see [SetWindowsHookEx](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/api/winuser/nf-winuser-setwindowshookexw)). In these cases, *prect* should contain a valid pointer to a [RECT](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/api/windef/ns-windef-rect) structure.

The **EM_SETRECT** message causes the text of the edit control to be redrawn. To change the size of the formatting rectangle without redrawing the text, use the **EM_SETRECTNP** message.

When an edit control is first created, the formatting rectangle is set to a default size. You can use the **EM_SETRECT** message to make the formatting rectangle larger or smaller than the edit control window.

If the edit control does not have a horizontal scroll bar, and the formatting rectangle is set to be larger than the edit control window, lines of text exceeding the width of the edit control window (but smaller than the width of the formatting rectangle) are clipped instead of wrapped.

If the edit control contains a border, the formatting rectangle is reduced by the size of the border. If you are adjusting the rectangle returned by an **EM_GETRECT** message, you must remove the size of the border before using the rectangle with the **EM_SETRECT** message.

**Rich Edit**: Supported in Microsoft Rich Edit 1.0 and later. The formatting rectangle does not include the selection bar, which is an unmarked area to the left of each paragraph. When the user clicks in the selection bar, the corresponding line is selected.

---

## RichEdit_SetRectNP

Sets the formatting rectangle of a multiline rich edit control. The **EM_SETRECTNP** message is identical to the **EM_SETRECT** message, except that **EM_SETRECTNP** does not redraw the edit control window.

The formatting rectangle is the limiting rectangle into which the control draws the text. The limiting rectangle is independent of the size of the edit control window.

This message is processed only by multiline edit controls. You can send this message to either an edit control or a rich edit control.

```
SUB RichEdit_SetRectNP (BYVAL hRichEdit AS HWND, BYVAL fCoord AS LONG, BYVAL prect AS RECT PTR)
```

| Parameter  | Description |
| ---------- | ----------- |
| *hRichEdit* | The handle of the rich edit control. |
| *fCoord* | **Rich Edit 3.0 and later**: Indicates whether *prect* specifies absolute or relative coordinates. A value of zero indicates absolute coordinates. A value of 1 indicates offsets relative to the current formatting rectangle. (The offsets can be positive or negative.)<br>**Edit controls: This parameter is not used and must be zero. |
| *prect* | A pointer to a [RECT](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/api/windef/ns-windef-rect) structure that specifies the new dimensions of the rectangle. If this parameter is **NULL**, the formatting rectangle is set to its default values. |

#### Remarks

**Rich Edit**: Supported in Microsoft Rich Edit 3.0 and later.

| *pt* | Pointer to a [POINT]((https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/api/windef/ns-windef-point)) structure which specifies a point in the virtual text space of the document, expressed in pixels. The document will be scrolled until this point is located in the upper-left corner of the edit control window. If you want to change the view such that the upper left corner of the view is two lines down and one character in from the left edge. You would pass a point of (7, 22).<br>The rich edit control checks the x and y coordinates and adjusts them if necessary, so that a complete line is displayed at the top. It also ensures that the text is never completely scrolled off the view rectangle. |

#### Return value

This message always returns 1.

---

## RichEdit_SetSel

Selects a range of characters in an edit control.

```
SUB RichEdit_SetSel (BYVAL hRichEdit AS HWND, BYVAL nStart AS LONG, BYVAL nEnd AS LONG)
```

| Parameter  | Description |
| ---------- | ----------- |
| *hRichEdit* | The handle of the rich edit control. |
| *nStart* | The starting character position of the selection. |
| *nEnd* | The ending character position of the selection. |

#### Remarks

The start value can be greater than the end value. The lower of the two values specifies the character position of the first character in the selection. The higher value specifies the position of the first character beyond the selection.

The start value is the anchor point of the selection, and the end value is the active end. If the user uses the SHIFT key to adjust the size of the selection, the active end can move but the anchor point remains the same.

If the start is 0 and the end is -1, all the text in the edit control is selected. If the start is -1, any current selection is deselected.

**Edit controls**: The control displays a flashing caret at the end position regardless of the relative values of start and end.

**Rich Edit**: Supported in Microsoft Rich Edit 1.0 and later.

If the edit control has the **ES_NOHIDESEL** style, the selected text is highlighted regardless of whether the control has focus. Without the **ES_NOHIDESEL** style, the selected text is highlighted only when the edit control has the focus.

```
FUNCTION RichEdit_SetTableParams (BYVAL hRichEdit AS HWND, BYVAL lptp AS TABLEROWPARMS PTR, _
   BYVAL lptcp AS TABLECELLPARMS PTR) AS DWORD
```

| Parameter  | Description |
| ---------- | ----------- |
| *hRichEdit* | The handle of the rich edit control. |
| *lptp* | A pointer to a [TABLEROWPARMS](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/api/richedit/ns-richedit-tablerowparms) structure. |
| *lptcp* | A pointer to a [TABLECELLPARMS](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/api/richedit/ns-richedit-tablecellparms) structure. |

#### Return value

Returns **S_OK** if successful, or one of the following error codes.

| Return code  | Description |
| ------------ | ----------- |
| **E_FAIL** | Changes cannot be made. This can occur if the control is a plain-text or single-line control, or if the insertion point is inside a math object. It also occurs if tables are disabled if the **RichEdit_SetEditStyleEx** message sets the **SES_EX_NOTABLE** value. |
| **E_INVALIDARG** | The *lptp* or *lptcp* parameters are NULL or point to an invalid structure. The **cbRow** member of the **TABLEROWPARMS** structure must equal sizeof(TABLEROWPARMS) or sizeof(TABLEROWPARMS) 2*sizeof(long). The latter value is the size of the RichEdit 4.1 **TABLEROWPARMS** structure. The **cbCell** member of the **TABLEROWPARMS** structure must equal sizeof(TABLECELLPARMS). The query character position must be at a table row delimiter. |
| **E_OUTOFMEMORY** | Insufficient memory is available. |

#### Remarks

This message changes the parameters of the number of rows specified by the **cRow** member of the **TABLEROWPARMS** structure, if the table has that many consecutive rows. If **cRow** is less than 0, the message iterates until the end of the table. If the new cell count differs from the current cell count by +1 or 1, it inserts or deletes the cell at the index specified by the **iCell** member of **TABLEROWPARMS**. The starting table row is identified by a character position. This position is specified by **cpStartRow** members with values that are greater than or equal to zero. The position should be inside the table row, but not inside a nested table, unless you want to change that table s parameters. If the **cpStartRow** member is 1, the character position is given by the current selection. For this, position the selection anywhere inside the table row, or select the row with the active end of the selection at the end of the table row.

---

## RichEdit_SetTabStops

Sets the tab stops in a multiline rich edit control. The **EM_SETTABSTOPS** message sets the tab stops in a multiline edit control. When text is copied to the control, any tab character in the text causes space to be generated up to the next tab stop. This message is processed only by multiline edit controls.

```
FUNCTION RichEdit_SetTabStops (BYVAL hRichEdit AS HWND, BYVAL nTabs AS LONG, BYVAL rgTabStops AS LONG_PTR) AS LONG
```

| Parameter  | Description |
| ---------- | ----------- |
| *hRichEdit* | The handle of the rich edit control. |
| *nTabs* | The number of tab stops contained in the array. If this parameter is zero, the *rgTabStops* parameter is ignored and default tab stops are set at every 32 dialog template units. If this parameter is 1, tab stops are set at every n dialog template units, where n is the distance pointed to by the *rgTabStops* parameter. If this parameter is greater than 1, *rgTabStops* is a pointer to an array of tab stops. |
| *rgTabStops* | A pointer to an array of unsigned integers specifying the tab stops, in dialog template units. If the *nTabs* parameter is 1, this parameter is a pointer to an unsigned integer containing the distance between all tab stops, in dialog template units. |

#### Return value

If all the tabs are set, the return value is *TRUE*.

If all the tabs are not set, the return value is *FALSE*.

#### Remarks

The **EM_SETTABSTOPS** message does not automatically redraw the edit control window. If the application is changing the tab stops for text already in the edit control, it should call the Windows API **InvalidateRect** function to redraw the edit control window.

The values specified in the array are in dialog template units, which are the device-independent units used in dialog box templates. To convert measurements from dialog template units to screen units (pixels), use the Windows API **MapDialogRect** function.

**Rich Edit**: Supported in Microsoft Rich Edit 3.0 and later. A rich edit control can have the maximum number of tab stops specified by **MAX_TAB_STOPS**.

---

## RichEdit_SetTargetDevice

The return value is zero if the operation fails, or nonzero if it succeeds.

#### Remarks

The HDC for the default printer can be obtained as follows.

```
DIM hdc AS HDC
DIM pd AS PRINTDLGW
pd.lStructSize = SIZEOF(pd)
pd.flags = PD_RETURNDC OR PD_RETURNDEFAULT
IF PrintDlgW(@pd) THEN
   hdc =  = pd.hDC
END IF
```

If *lnwidth* is zero, no line breaks are created.

---

## RichEdit_SetText

| *pwszText* | Pointer to the null-terminated text to insert. This text is an ANSI string, unless the code page is 1200 (Unicode). If *pwszText* starts with a valid RTF ASCII sequence for example, "{\rtf" or "{urtf" the text is read in using the RTF reader. |

#### Return value

If the operation is setting all of the text and succeeds, the return value is 1.

If the operation is setting the selection and succeeds, the return value is the number of bytes or characters copied.

If the operation fails, the return value is zero.

---

## RichEdit_SetTextMode

Sets the text mode or undo level of a rich edit control. The message fails if the control contains any text.

```
FUNCTION RichEdit_SetTextMode (BYVAL hRichEdit AS HWND, BYVAL pvalues AS LONG) AS LONG
```

| Parameter  | Description |
| ---------- | ----------- |
| *hRichEdit* | The handle of the rich edit control. |
| *pvalues* | One or more values from the [TEXTMODE](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/api/richedit/ne-richedit-textmode) enumeration type. The values specify the new settings for the control's text mode and undo level parameters. |

Specify one of the following values to set the text mode parameter. If you do not specify a text mode value, the text mode remains at its current setting.

| Value  | Meaning |
| ------ | ----------- |
| **TM_PLAINTEXT** | Indicates plain text mode, in which the control is similar to a standard edit control. For more information about plain text mode, see the **Remarks** section. |
| **TM_RICHTEXT** | Indicates rich text mode, in which the control has standard rich edit functionality. Rich text mode is the default setting. |

Specify one of the following values to set the undo level parameter. If you do not specify an undo level value, the undo level remains at its current setting.

| Value  | Meaning |
| ------ | ----------- |
| **TM_SINGLELEVELUNDO** | The control allows the user to undo only the last action that can be undone. |
| **TM_MULTILEVELUNDO** | The control supports multiple undo operations. This is the default setting. Use the **RichEdit_SetUndoLimit** message to set the maximum number of undo actions. |

Specify one of the following values to set the code page parameter. If you do not specify an code page value, the code page remains at its current setting.

| Value  | Meaning |
| ------ | ----------- |
| **TM_SINGLECODEPAGE** | The control only allows the English keyboard and a keyboard corresponding to the default character set. For example, you could have Greek and English. Note that this prevents Unicode text from entering the control. For example, use this value if a Rich Edit control must be restricted to ANSI text. |
| **TM_MULTICODEPAGE** | The control allows multiple code pages and Unicode text into the control. This is the default setting. |

#### Return value

If the message succeeds, the return value is zero.

If the message fails, the return value is a nonzero value.

#### Remarks

In rich text mode, a rich edit control has standard rich edit functionality. However, in plain text mode, the control is similar to a standard edit control:

- The text in a plain text control can have only one format (such as Bold, 10pt Arial).
- The user cannot paste rich text formats, such as Rich Text Format (RTF) or embedded objects into a plain text control.
- Rich text mode controls always have a default end-of-document marker or carriage return, to format paragraphs. Plain text controls, on the other hand, do not need the default, end-of-document marker, so it is omitted.

The control must contain no text when it receives the **RichEdit_SetText** message. To ensure there is no text, send a **RichEdit_SetText** message with an empty string ("").

---

## RichEdit_SetTouchOptions

---

## RichEdit_SetUndoLimit

Sets the maximum number of actions that can stored in the undo queue of a rich edit control.

```
FUNCTION RichEdit_SetUndoLimit (BYVAL hRichEdit AS HWND, BYVAL maxactions AS DWORD) AS DWORD
```

| Parameter  | Description |
| ---------- | ----------- |
| *hRichEdit* | The handle of the rich edit control. |
| *maxactions* | Specifies the maximum number of actions that can be stored in the undo queue. |

#### Return value

The return value is the new maximum number of undo actions for the rich edit control. This value may be less than *maxactions* if memory is limited.

#### Remarks

By default, the maximum number of actions in the undo queue is 100. If you increase this number, there must be enough available memory to accommodate the new number. For better performance, set the limit to the smallest possible value.

Setting the limit to zero disables the **Undo** feature.

---

## RichEdit_SetWordBreakProc

Replaces a rich edit control's default Wordwrap function with an application-defined Wordwrap function.

```
SUB RichEdit_SetWordBreakProc (BYVAL hRichEdit AS HWND, BYVAL pfn AS LONG_PTR)
```

| Parameter  | Description |
| ---------- | ----------- |
| *hRichEdit* | The handle of the rich edit control. |

#### Remarks

A Wordwrap function scans a text buffer that contains text to be sent to the screen, looking for the first word that does not fit on the current screen line. The Wordwrap function places this word at the beginning of the next line on the screen.

A Wordwrap function defines the point at which the system should break a line of text for multiline edit controls, usually at a space character that separates two words. Either a multiline or a single-line edit control might call this function when the user presses arrow keys in combination with the CTRL key to move the caret to the next word or previous word. The default Wordwrap function breaks a line of text at a space character. The application-defined function may define the Wordwrap to occur at a hyphen or a character other than the space character.

**Rich Edit**: Supported in Microsoft Rich Edit 1.0 and later.

#### Remarks

This message is only valid when the control is in-place active. Calls made while the control is inactive may fail.

---

## RichEdit_StopGroupTyping

Stops a rich edit control from collecting additional typing actions into the current undo action. The control stores the next typing action, if any, into a new action in the undo queue.

```
FUNCTION RichEdit_StopGroupTyping (BYVAL hRichEdit AS HWND) AS DWORD
```

| Parameter  | Description |
| ---------- | ----------- |
| *hRichEdit* | The handle of the rich edit control. |

#### Return value

- The control receives an **EM_STOPGROUPTYPING** message.
- The control loses focus.
- The user moves the current selection, either by using the arrow keys or by clicking the mouse.
- The user presses the **Delete** key.
- The user performs any other action, such as a paste operation that does not involve typing.

You can send the **RichEdit_StopGroupTyping** message to break consecutive typing actions into smaller undo groups. For example, you could send **RichEdit_StopGroupTyping** after each character or at each word break.

---

## RichEdit_StreamIn

Replaces the contents of a rich edit control with a stream of data provided by an application defined [EditStreamCallback](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/api/richedit/nc-richedit-editstreamcallback) callback function.

```
FUNCTION RichEdit_StreamIn (BYVAL hRichEdit AS HWND, BYVAL psf AS LONG, BYVAL pedst AS EDITSTREAM PTR) AS DWORD
```

| Parameter  | Description |
| ---------- | ----------- |
| *hRichEdit* | The handle of the rich edit control. |

On output, the **dwError** member can contain a nonzero error code if an error occurred. |

#### Data format and replacement options

| Value  | Meaning |
| ------ | ------- |
| **SF_RTF** | RTF |
| **SF_TEXT** | Text |

In addition, you can specify the following flags.

| Value  | Meaning |
| ------ | ------- |
| **SFF_PLAINRTF** | If specified, only keywords common to all languages are streamed in. Language-specific RTF keywords in the stream are ignored. If not specified, all keywords are streamed in. You can combine this flag with the **SF_RTF** flag. |
| **SFF_SELECTION** | If specified, the data stream replaces the contents of the current selection. If not specified, the data stream replaces the entire contents of the control. You can combine this flag with the **SF_TEXT** or **SF_RTF** flags. |
| **SF_UNICODE** | **Rich Edit 2.0 and later**: Indicates Unicode text. You can combine this flag with the **SF_TEXT** flag. |
| **SF_USECODEPAGE** | **Rich Edit 3.0 and later**: Reads UTF-8 RTF and text using other code pages. The code page is set in the high word of *psf*. For example, for UTF-8 RTF, set *psf* to (CP_UTF8 << 16) | SF_USECODEPAGE | SF_RTF. |

#### Return value

This message returns the number of characters read.

#### Remarks

When you send an **RichEdit_StreamIn** message, the rich edit control makes repeated calls to the **EditStreamCallback** function specified by the **pfnCallback** member of the [EDITSTREAM](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/api/richedit/ns-richedit-editstream) structure. Each time the callback function is called, it fills a buffer with data to read into the control. This continues until the callback function indicates that the stream-in operation has been completed or an error occurs.

---

## RichEdit_StreamOut

Causes a rich edit control to pass its contents to an application defined [EditStreamCallback](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/api/richedit/nc-richedit-editstreamcallback) callback function. The callback function can then write the stream of data to a file or any other location that it chooses.

```
FUNCTION RichEdit_StreamOut (BYVAL hRichEdit AS HWND, BYVAL psf AS LONG, BYVAL pedst AS EDITSTREAM PTR) AS DWORD
```

| Parameter  | Description |
| ---------- | ----------- |
| *hRichEdit* | The handle of the rich edit control. |
| *psf* | Specifies the data format and replacement options. This value must be one of the following values (see table below). |
| *pedst* | Pointer to an [EDITSTREAM](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/api/richedit/ns-richedit-editstream) structure. On input, the **pfnCallback** member of this structure must point to an application defined **EditStreamCallback** function. On output, the **dwError** member can contain a nonzero error code if an error occurred. |

#### Data format and replacement options

| Value  | Meaning |
| ------ | ------- |
| **SF_RTF** | RTF |
| **SF_RTFNOOBJS** | RTF with spaces in place of COM objects. |
| **SF_TEXT** | Text |
| **SF_TEXTIZED** | Text with a text representation of COM objects. |

The **SF_RTFNOOBJS** option is useful if an application stores COM objects itself, as RTF representation of COM objects is not very compact. The control word, \objattph, followed by a space denotes the object position.

In addition, you can specify the following flags.

| Value  | Meaning |
| ------ | ------- |
| **SFF_PLAINRTF** | If specified, the rich edit control streams out only the keywords common to all languages, ignoring language-specific keywords. If not specified, the rich edit control streams out all keywords. You can combine this flag with the SF_RTF or **SF_RTFNOOBJS** flag. |
| **SFF_SELECTION** | If specified, the rich edit control streams out only the contents of the current selection. If not specified, the control streams out the entire contents. You can combine this flag with any of data format values. |
| **SF_UNICODE** | **Rich Edit 2.0 and later**: Indicates Unicode text. You can combine this flag with the **SF_TEXT** flag. |
| **SF_USECODEPAGE** | **Rich Edit 3.0 and later**: Reads UTF-8 RTF and text using other code pages. The code page is set in the high word of *psf*. For example, for UTF-8 RTF, set *psf* to (CP_UTF8 << 16) | SF_USECODEPAGE | SF_RTF. |

#### Return value

This message returns the number of characters written to the data stream.

#### Remarks

When you send an **RichEdit_StreamOut** message, the rich edit control makes repeated calls to the **EditStreamCallback** function specified by the **pfnCallback** member of the [EDITSTREAM](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/api/richedit/ns-richedit-editstream) structure.  Each time it calls the callback function, the control passes a buffer containing a portion of the contents of the control.

## RichEdit_Undo

This message undoes the last edit control operation in the control's undo queue.

```
FUNCTION RichEdit_Undo (BYVAL hRichEdit AS HWND) AS LONG
```

| Parameter  | Description |
| ---------- | ----------- |
| *hRichEdit* | The handle of the rich edit control. |

#### Return value

For a single-line edit control, the return value is always **TRUE**.

For a multiline edit control, the return value is **TRUE** if the undo operation is successful, or **FALSE** if the undo operation fails.

#### Remarks

**Edit controls and Rich Edit 1.0**: An undo operation can also be undone. For example, you can restore deleted text with the first **EM_UNDO** message, and remove the text again with a second **EM_UNDO** message as long as there is no intervening edit operation.

**Rich Edit 2.0 and later**: The undo feature is multilevel so sending two **EM_UNDO** messages will undo the last two operations in the undo queue. To redo an operation, send the **EM_REDO** message.

**Rich Edit**: Supported in Microsoft Rich Edit 1.0 and later.

# CPowerTime Class

A **CPowerTime** object contains a date and time value, allowing easy calculations. The date and time value is stored as a 64-bit value representing the number of 100-nanosecond intervals since January 1, 1601. A nanosecond is one-billionth of a second.

The following static const member variables are provided to simplify calculations (number of 100-nanosecond intervals):

```
CPowerTime_Millisecond    10000ull
CPowerTime_Second         CPowerTime_Millisecond * 1000
CPowerTime_Minute         CPowerTime_Second * 60
CPowerTime_Hour           CPowerTime_Minute * 60
CPowerTime_Day            CPowerTime_Hour * 24
CPowerTime_Week           CPowerTime_Day * 7
```

#### Remarks

A date serial is a number that holds a date and time value in the same format used by PDS or VBDOS. The value is a count of the days from 0:00 AM of December 30,1899; it's mainly used for easy counting of the time between two dates.

The date serial unit is one day and the fractional part represents the time of the day. If a date serial is written into an integer, the time is lost. FreeBASIC date serials are not limited to dates between 1753 and 2078 as in VBDOS. FreeBASIC date serial handling functions use Double arguments.

FreeBASIC date serial handling functions require the inclusion of vbcompat.bi or datetime.bi in the source.

A date serial can be created by the functions Now, TimeSerial+DateSerial, or DateValue+TimeValue.

The functions Year, Month, Weekday, Day, Hour, Minute, Second allow to recover the different components of a date serial.

The Format function has formatting expressions to print date serials in a human readable way.

#### Usage examples

```
DIM ct AS CPowerTime
ct.DateSerial = DateSerial(2019, 2, 4)
Print Format(ct.DateSerial, "yyyy/mm/dd") 
ct.DateSerial = DateValue("4/2/2019")
Print Format(ct.DateSerial, "yyyy/mm/dd") 
ct.DateSerial = TimeValue("11:59:59PM")
Print Format(dt, "hh:mm:ss")
ct.DateSerial = Now
Print Format(ct.DateSerial, "yyyy/mm/dd hh:mm:ss") 
ct.DateSerial = DateSerial(2005, 11, 28) + TimeSerial(7, 30, 50)
Print Format(ct.DateSerial, "yyyy/mm/dd hh:mm:ss")

## NewTime

Sets a new time to this **CPowerTime** object.

The time component of the **CPowerTime** object is assigned a new value based upon the specified parameters. The date component is unchanged. If parameters are invalid, **GetLastError** will return ERROR_INVALID_PARAMETER.

```
SUB NewTime (BYVAL nHour AS LONG = 0, BYVAL nMinute AS LONG = 0, _
    BYVAL nSecond AS LONG = 0, BYVAL nMSecond AS LONG = 0)
```

| Parameter  | Description |
